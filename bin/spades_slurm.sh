# Genome coverage
Alignment of Reads:

Align your sequencing reads to the assembled genome. Common tools for this task include BWA, Bowtie2, or HISAT2 for short reads, or tools like Minimap2 for long reads.
Calculate Coverage:

After the alignment, you can use tools like Samtools or BEDTools to calculate the coverage depth at each position in the genome.
Average Coverage:

Calculate the average coverage across the entire genome. This is often expressed as "X coverage," where X is the average depth of coverage.
Example using Samtools:
Assuming you have your reads in a BAM file and your assembled genome in a FASTA file:

bash
Copy code
# Index the assembled genome
samtools faidx assembled_genome.fasta

# Sort and index the BAM file (if not already done)
samtools sort -o sorted_reads.bam input_reads.bam
samtools index sorted_reads.bam

# Calculate coverage
samtools depth -a sorted_reads.bam > coverage.txt
Now, the coverage.txt file contains information about the coverage at each position in the genome. You can calculate the average coverage and visualize the coverage distribution.

# Calculate average coverage
awk '{sum+=$3} END {print "Average Coverage: ", sum/NR}' coverage.txt
